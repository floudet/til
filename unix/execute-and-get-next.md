# Execute And Get Next

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> is one of the most useful keyboard shortcut in bash/zsh, allowing to search the command history.  

If you regularly type the same set of commands in the same order, you'll also find <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> very useful.  

From bash man page:
```
operate-and-get-next (C-o)
              Accept the current line for execution and fetch the next line relative to the current line from the history for editing.  Any argument is ignored.
```

Search the first command using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>, and use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> instead of <kbd>Return</kbd> to execute it, after execution it will bring up the following command in the command line prompt.
