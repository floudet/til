# less Simulate tail -f

`less` is used on Unix-like systems to view the contents of a text file. 

When in less, hit <kbd>F</kbd> to wait for additional data to be appended to the input (like `tail -f` would do).

`Waiting for data... (interrupt to abort)` will be displayed at the bottom of the screen and any new content appended to the file will be displayed automatically.

Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to stop this behavior.
