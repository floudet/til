# Switches Model Numbering Scheme

Cisco enterprise level switches model names follow the scheme below:

**WS** = Workgroup Switch
**C** = Catalyst
**4 digits number** indicating the Series/Model/Hardware Platform
**X** = Stackable
**G** = Gigabit-capable
**S** = SFP Small form-factor pluggable (Optical Transceiver)
**T** = twisted-pair Ethernet without Power over Ethernet (PoE)
**C** = Combo SFP and UTP - you can use only one type of interface.
**P** = twisted-pair with PoE
**F** = FULL Poe Power (only in some 48-port switches)
**D** = 10G XENPAK ports
**W** = indicates that the switch can operate as a WAN access controller for Cisco lightweight access points
**-** dash
**S** = for standard software feature set ï¼ˆLan Lite image)
**E** = for some type of enhanced feature set
**L** = LAN Base

So WS-C3750X-48P-S would be a 48-Port Catalyst Stackable Switch running the standard feature set.
