# TIL

> Today I Learned

I used to regularly put tips and tricks I learn day to day on a single text
file until I came across [this post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11068902) on HN.
Then I decided to steal this great idea to create my own TIL with all the 
findings I make during my work and nonwork-related activities.
