# Browse Tarfiles

The tar.vim plugin, included in all "modern" versions of vim allows to open a tar archive (compressed or not), view its contents and even edit the files it contains.

```bash
$ vim archive.tar.gz
```

As the [plugin page](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=522) mentions, gzip is required for handling `*.tar.Z`, `*.tar.gz`, and `*.tgz` compressed tarfiles, and bzip2 is required for handling `*.tar.bz2` compressed tarfiles.
